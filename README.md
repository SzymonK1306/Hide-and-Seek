# Multiagent reinforcement learning based on hide-and-seek game
This project demonstrates the possibilities of multiagent reinforcement learning using the example of a game of hide-and-seek. The implemented environment in unity allows training appropriate behaviors for seekers and hiders. Several trained models have also been prepared for different gameplay conditions. All of them are available in the prepared installer.

## 💻 Tech Stack
1. Unity (2022.3.9f1 LTS)
2. Python 3.9.13
3. Unity Machine Learning Agents

## 📶 Results:
The following shows the effects for different gameplay variants

### 1. Basic example
All agents have constant orientation and possition

### 2. Random orientation example
All agents have constant possition but are rotated by a random angle at the beginning of the episode

### 3. Random orientation example
All agents have constant orientation but hiders start from a random point
<div align="center">

  <img src="img/pos2.gif" alt="random_possition_2">
  <img src="img/pos3.gif" alt="random_possition_3">
</div>
